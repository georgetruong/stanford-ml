My exercise submissions for [Stanford's Machine Learning online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). Assignments are completed with [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) as per instruction, but I have also rewritten them in Python and Jupyter for learning purposes. For more information about the exercises, please refer to each exercise's PDF file in the exercise's folder (ie `ex1.pdf`).

Let me know if anything could be done better. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Thank you!
