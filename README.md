Exercises for Stanford Machine Learning course on [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)

Assignments are originally done with [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), but I also refactored them to use Python and Jupyter

Please view PDF in each Octave excercise folder for more details
